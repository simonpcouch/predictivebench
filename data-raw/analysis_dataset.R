Here's some information on a multiple choice question:

ID:\n {id}\n\n
INTRODUCTION:\n {introduction}\n\n
QUESTION:\n {question}\n\n
TARGET (current):\n {target}\n\n
DIRECTORY:\n {dir}\n\n

I would like to make this multiple choice question in an open-ended question by
extracting:

- target: The actual correct answer text (not the letter). e.g., if the target says 'D' and the multiple choice question has options A. 72, B. 73, C. 74, D. 75, just return '75'.
- introduction: The full introduction, unchanged besides 1) references to irrelevant questions removed, and 2) references from this relevant question incorporated into the introduction with no question ID/number.
- question: The question text only, with no multiple choice options. If the question is ambiguous in its current writing (e.g. if there's a free text response that requires specific componenets), rephrase the question to ask for the components required in the target.
- dir: As it was provided

# Now, we want the initial question to look more like an analyst might actually
# ask. At the moment, the initial questions are quite long if provided with
# all of the introduction; all of the information needed to answer the question
# is inside of the first prompt. This is unlike what a real data science would
# likely actually see in practice; in practice, an agent might get a few sentences
# of prompting, and otherwise will need to elicit information from the user.
#
# We can use the "mock analyst" to help solve this problem; the current initial
# prompt (as question + introduction) will be rejiggered slightly; `question`
# is the initial prompt that is actually provided to the solver model and has
# the original question and a few sentences of context, `knowledge` is
# information that the mock analyst has access to that it will freely give
# to the solver model if the model asks for it. In this way:
#
# * It's less of an issue if the eval "leaks" into the training data as the
#   thing the solver model initially sees is a couple sentences identifying a
#   problem at a high level.
# * Interactions look more like "real" data science when an analyst uses an AI
#   assistant.

Here's a data analysis introduction and question that, altogether with some data files, currently contain all of the information needed to solve the question.

{{introduction}}\n{introduction}\n{{/introduction}}\n\n

{{question}}\n{question}\n{{/question}}\n 

I'd like to supplement the question with enough information to get an AI assistant started in working on a problem and then add a bit more structure to the introductions. Please restructure this into two parts:

1. question: A brief initial prompt (3-4 sentences) that an analyst might write in first person when asking an AI assistant for help with a data analysis problem. This should include the original question as well as a few additional pieces of context and requirements from the introduction. It should be written in first-person.

2. knowledge: The remaining detailed information, context, and specifics from the introduction. This should be organized into natural buckets of information (e.g., assumptions, factual context, data descriptions, constraints, etc.) with each bucket as a separate string in an array. Those buckets will likely be outlined already in the original introduction; if so, just use those.

The question should sound like a typical analyst might have written it when initially approaching an AI assistant for help.
