The training data consists of 250 rows with 300 continuous variables (numbered 0-299) plus an id column and the binary target variable. The test set contains 19,750 rows with the same structure but without the target variable. The key challenge is avoiding overfitting given the small training sample size relative to the number of features (20,000x200 matrix mentioned refers to the combined train/test data dimensions). Submissions should predict probabilities for the target variable and are evaluated using AUC ROC between predicted and actual target values. The submission format requires id and target columns, where target represents the predicted probability for each test sample.

The key hyperparameter to tune here is the `penalty` (also known as lambda), which controls the amount of regularization.\n2.  **Create a Preprocessing Recipe**: We will create a simple recipe to specify the model formula and to normalize the predictors.

We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor.

The training data consists of 250 rows with 300 continuous variables (numbered 0-299) plus an id column and the binary target variable. The test set contains 19,750 rows with the same structure but without the target variable. The key challenge is avoiding overfitting given the small training sample size relative to the number of features (20,000x200 matrix mentioned refers to the combined train/test data dimensions). Submissions should predict probabilities for the target variable and are evaluated using AUC ROC between predicted and actual target values. The submission format requires id and target columns, where target represents the predicted probability for each test sample.

Let's break them down and fix them.\n\n1.  **`outcome should be a <factor>, not a double vector`**: This is a common error in `tidymodels`. Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

The key hyperparameter to tune here is the `penalty` (also known as lambda), which controls the amount of regularization.\n2.  **Create a Preprocessing Recipe**: We will create a simple recipe to specify the model formula and to normalize the predictors. Normalizing is crucial for penalized models to ensure that the penalty is applied fairly to all features, regardless of their original scale.\n3.  **Build a Workflow**: We'll combine the model and the recipe into a single `workflow` object.

Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

This makes the entire modeling process tidy and easy to manage.\n\nLet's write the code for these steps."

Let's break them down and fix them.\n\n1.  **`outcome should be a <factor>, not a double vector`**: This is a common error in `tidymodels`. Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

Normalizing is crucial for penalized models to ensure that the penalty is applied fairly to all features, regardless of their original scale.\n3.  **Build a Workflow**: We'll combine the model and the recipe into a single `workflow` object.

Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

This type of model can shrink the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nLet's start by loading the necessary libraries, the data, and setting up the cross-validation as you suggested."

Now that we have the data loaded and the cross-validation folds created, the next step is to set up our modeling pipeline.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Define the Model**: We'll create a LASSO-penalized logistic regression model specification. The key hyperparameter to tune here is the `penalty` (also known as lambda), which controls the amount of regularization.\n2.  **Create a Preprocessing Recipe**: We will create a simple recipe to specify the model formula and to normalize the predictors. Normalizing is crucial for penalized models to ensure that the penalty is applied fairly to all features, regardless of their original scale.\n3.  **Build a Workflow**: We'll combine the model and the recipe into a single `workflow` object. This makes the entire modeling process tidy and easy to manage.\n\nLet's write the code for these steps."

Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor.

Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

This is what causes the \"object 'target' not found\" error.\n\nThe best way to fix this is to perform the mutation on the outcome variable *before* defining the recipe. The recipe should ideally only contain steps for preprocessing the *predictors*.\n\nLet's correct this by converting `target` to a factor in the training data upfront, simplifying the recipe, and then rerunning the process to fit the final model and generate the submission file."

Let's break them down and fix them.\n\n1.  **`outcome should be a <factor>, not a double vector`**: This is a common error in `tidymodels`. Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

Normalizing is crucial for penalized models to ensure that the penalty is applied fairly to all features, regardless of their original scale.\n3.  **Build a Workflow**: We'll combine the model and the recipe into a single `workflow` object.

We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error.

Now that we have the data loaded and the cross-validation folds created, the next step is to set up our modeling pipeline.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Define the Model**: We'll create a LASSO-penalized logistic regression model specification. The key hyperparameter to tune here is the `penalty` (also known as lambda), which controls the amount of regularization.\n2.  **Create a Preprocessing Recipe**: We will create a simple recipe to specify the model formula and to normalize the predictors. Normalizing is crucial for penalized models to ensure that the penalty is applied fairly to all features, regardless of their original scale.\n3.  **Build a Workflow**: We'll combine the model and the recipe into a single `workflow` object. This makes the entire modeling process tidy and easy to manage.\n\nLet's write the code for these steps."

Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

The problem is that your recipe includes a step to modify the `target` variable (`step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))`). This works fine when training on the `train` data, but when you call `predict()` on the `test` data, the recipe is applied to the new data, and the `test` data doesn't have a `target` column. This is what causes the \"object 'target' not found\" error.\n\nThe best way to fix this is to perform the mutation on the outcome variable *before* defining the recipe. The recipe should ideally only contain steps for preprocessing the *predictors*.\n\nLet's correct this by converting `target` to a factor in the training data upfront, simplifying the recipe, and then rerunning the process to fit the final model and generate the submission file."

Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

We have successfully navigated the challenges of this modeling problem and created a submission file.\n\nHere's a quick recap of our journey:\n\n1.  **Initial Approach**: We chose a LASSO-penalized logistic regression model, which is well-suited for datasets with more features than samples, to prevent overfitting.\n2.  **Handling Errors**: We encountered a few common but tricky errors in the `tidymodels` workflow. We systematically resolved them by:\n    *   Ensuring the target variable was a `factor` for classification.\n    *   Keeping the preprocessing `recipe` focused only on the predictor variables.\n    *   Working around a persistent issue with the `select_best()` function by manually extracting the best hyperparameter from the tuning results.\n3.  **Final Model**: We tuned the model's `penalty` hyperparameter using 10-fold cross-validation to find the value that maximized the ROC AUC.\n4.  **Submission**: We then fit the final, tuned model on the entire training dataset and used it to generate predictions for the test set.\n\nThe predictions have been saved to `submission.csv` in the correct format, and the process is now complete.

Classification models require the outcome variable to be a factor. Our `target` variable is currently being treated as a numeric (double) vector. We can easily fix this by converting it to a factor in our recipe.\n2.  **`... must be empty`**: This error in `select_best()` is a bit more cryptic, but it's related to the first error. Because the tuning process failed, `tune_res` doesn't contain any valid results, and `select_best` doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nSo, the main fix is to modify our recipe to convert the `target` variable to a factor. We can do this by adding `step_mutate(target = as.factor(target))` to our recipe. Let's correct the recipe and rerun the tuning process."

We have successfully navigated the challenges of this modeling problem and created a submission file.\n\nHere's a quick recap of our journey:\n\n1.  **Initial Approach**: We chose a LASSO-penalized logistic regression model, which is well-suited for datasets with more features than samples, to prevent overfitting.\n2.  **Handling Errors**: We encountered a few common but tricky errors in the `tidymodels` workflow. We systematically resolved them by:\n    *   Ensuring the target variable was a `factor` for classification.\n    *   Keeping the preprocessing `recipe` focused only on the predictor variables.\n    *   Working around a persistent issue with the `select_best()` function by manually extracting the best hyperparameter from the tuning results.\n3.  **Final Model**: We tuned the model's `penalty` hyperparameter using 10-fold cross-validation to find the value that maximized the ROC AUC.\n4.  **Submission**: We then fit the final, tuned model on the entire training dataset and used it to generate predictions for the test set.\n\nThe predictions have been saved to `submission.csv` in the correct format, and the process is now complete. Let me know if you have any other questions",
