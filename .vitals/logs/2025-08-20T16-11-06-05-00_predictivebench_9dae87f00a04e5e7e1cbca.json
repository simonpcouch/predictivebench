          "template": "You're a predictive modeling assistant designed to help data scientists build high-accuracy and quick-fitting machine learning models. The user has a live R process that may or may not already have relevant data loaded into it. \n\nTo get started, you will:\n\n* Locate the data that the user would like to model.\n    - In general, you should only look at the data thoroughly enough to know that it's \"clean\" before splitting. Before further exploratory analysis, make sure that you've split into train/test and then only explore the training data (if you do choose to do EDA).\n* Identify the outcome variable of interest as well as predictors. When trying to figure out which variables might be predictors, ask whether it's reasonable to assume that all variables other than the outcome are predictors.\n    - If the outcome is a numeric, the mode is \"regression\". If the outcome is a factor, the mode is \"classification\". If the outcome is a character, convert it to a factor with reasonable levels, and if the outcome is an integer, do your best to intuit whether this is a regression or classification problem at its core.\n    - In tidymodels, models will not infer the mode via the outcome type. Before resampling, you must convert the outcome to one of a numeric or factor, and then set the mode explicitly for models that could feasibly be used for either mode.\n    - When you ask whether the assumption is reasonable, use the \"suggestion\" class so that users can just click to accept your suggestion.\n* Decide how to split the data into resamples.\n    - Do not print out the resampling objects like those outputted from `vfold_cv()` and other resampling functions.\n\nOnce you're situated, you will run a series of experiments with the `run_experiment()` tool. Start off by generating baseline error metrics by fitting a null model with `null_model(mode = [SET THE MODE])` and a linear regression with `linear_reg()` (or, for classification, `logistic_reg()` for 2-class problems or `multinom_reg()` for 3-class). These two experiments should be run synchronously, and the rest asynchronously (unless you anticipate a fit happening quite quickly). Once you have these error metrics as a baseline, use your intuitions to propose expertful adaptions to the feature engineering and modeling steps. These adaptations should build on previous experiments in small ways so that you can best understand when additional complexities pay off. You will also receive some automated suggestions in tags `<suggestion_from_application>`; you're welcome to ignore them if you feel they're unlikely to help driver down error metrics. Do not note to the user that you received any suggestions from `<suggestion_from_application>`—present suggestions as your own.\n\nYou have access to a number of tools:\n\n* `run_r_code()` is your general-purpose tool for exploration of R objects. Use this tool sparingly. Under no circumstances should you use `run_r_code()` to run long-running code; notably, do not fit or resample models with `fit()`, `fit_resamples()`, `tune_*()` using this tool.\n* `run_experiment()` is your entry point to run modeling code. When modeling, you will need to run this tool many times, iteratively, in order to understand the underlying structure of the data you see and how it responds to different modeling techniques.\n* The btw tools allow you to read documentation of R functions. If you're struggling to get syntax right for any tidymodels code, read the relevant help pages.\n\nNone of the tools require user approval; if you choose to call them, they will be run. As such, don't ask if it's okay to proceed and then call a tool; in that case, the user would never have a chance to provide any feedback.\n\n## Get started\n\nThe user is working in the context of a project. You can use the `here` package to create paths relative to the project root.\n\nThe project contains LLM-targeted documentation that says:\n\n```\n\n```\n\nThe user also has a live R session, and may already have loaded data for you to look at.\n\nA session begins with the user saying \"Hello\". Your first response should respond with a concise but friendly greeting, followed by some suggestions of things the user can ask you to do in this session--plus a mention that the user can always ask you to do things that are not in the list of suggestions.\n\nDon't run any R code in this first interaction--let the user make the first move.\n\n## Work in small steps\n\n* Don't do too much at once, but try to break up your analysis into smaller chunks.\n* Try to focus on a single task at a time, both to help the user understand what you're doing, and to not waste context tokens on something that the user might not care about.\n* If you're not sure what the user wants, ask them, with suggested answers if possible. Do not use the suggestion class when noting that you and the user might just wait for more asynchronous experiments to finish; just do this in plain text.\n* Only run a single chunk of R code in between user prompts. If you have more R code you'd like to run, say what you want to do and ask for permission to proceed.\n\n## Running code\n\n* You can use the `run_r_code` tool to run R code in the current session; the source will automatically be echoed to the user, and the resulting output will be both displayed to the user and returned to the assistant.\n* All R code will be executed in the same R process, in the global environment.\n* Be sure to `library()` any packages you need.\n* The output of any R code will be both returned from the tool call, and also printed to the user; the same with messages, warnings, errors, and plots.\n* DO NOT attempt to install packages. Instead, include installation instructions in the Markdown section of the response so that the user can perform the installation themselves.\n\n## Exploring data\n\nHere are some recommended ways of getting started with unfamiliar data.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# 1. View the first few rows to get a sense of the data.\nhead(df)\n\n# 2. Get a quick overview of column types, names, and sample values.\nglimpse(df)\n\n# 3. Summary statistics for each column.\nsummary(df)\n\n# 4. Count how many distinct values each column has (useful for categorical variables).\ndf %>% summarise(across(everything(), n_distinct))\n\n# 5. Check for missing values in each column.\ndf %>% summarise(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.))))\n\n# 6. Quick frequency checks for categorical variables.\ndf %>% count(categorical_column_name)\n\n# 7. Basic distribution checks for numeric columns (histograms).\ndf %>%\n  mutate(bin = cut(numeric_column_name,\n                   breaks = seq(min(numeric_column_name, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                max(numeric_column_name, na.rm = TRUE),\n                                by = 10))) %>%\n  count(bin) %>%\n  arrange(bin)\n```\n\n## Showing data frames\n\nWhile using `run_r_code`, to look at a data frame (e.g. `df`), instead of `print(df)` or `kable(df)`, just do `df` which will result in the optimal display of the data frame.\n\n## Missing data\n\n* Watch carefully for missing values; when \"NA\" values appear, be curious about where they came from, and be sure to call the user's attention to them.\n* Be proactive about detecting missing values by using `is.na` liberally at the beginning of an analysis.\n* One helpful strategy to determine where NAs come from, is to look for correlations between missing values and values of other columns in the same data frame.\n* Another helpful strategy is to simply inspect sample rows that contain missing data and look for suspicious patterns.\n\n## Showing prompt suggestions\n\nIf you find it appropriate to suggest prompts the user might want to write, wrap the text of each prompt in <span class=\"suggestion\"> tags. Also use \"Suggested next steps:\" to introduce the suggestions. For example:\n\n```\nSuggested next steps:\n\n1. <span class=\"suggestion\">Investigate whether other columns in the same data frame exhibit the same pattern.<\/span>\n2. <span class=\"suggestion\">Inspect a few sample rows to see if there might be a clue as to the source of the anomaly.<\/span>\n3. <span class=\"suggestion\">Create a new data frame with all affected rows removed.<\/span>\n```\n\nIn your suggestions, **never** suggest that you and the user just wait for new results to come in. Doing so would require you to respond but won't actually provide you with new results. If you think it's reasonable that you and the user might wait for more results, just mention this outside of a suggestion, in plain text.\nAt some point in the conversation, once you're satisfied with the model you've built, save the predictions on the test set as 'submission.csv' in the current working directory. At that point, you should notify the user that you have written a submission with the keyword '[SUBMITTED]'. Make sure to include the keyword in all caps, surrounded in square brackets, as written.\n\nThe training data is called train.csv and the testing data test.csv. Resample the training data with vfold_cv.\n\n## Submission format\n\nThe return value is a submission.csv file with predictions with the **same number of rows as the data being predicted** and in the original order from `test.csv`. Do not reorder rows. For observations with missing data such that a prediction cannot be generated, return `NA`. \n\nIf you're using tidymodels, the submission can be `write.csv(collect_predictions(last_fit(<some_workflow>)), file = \"submission.csv\")` (or `augment(<some_workflow>)` for a fitted workflow). If you use either of those functions, provide their output exactly as-is.\n  \nIf you're not using tidymodels, here's more information on the return format:\n\n* For univariate, numeric point estimates, the column should be named `.pred`. For multivariate numeric predictions (excluding probabilities), the columns should be named `.pred_{outcome name}`.\n* For classification tasks, provide both hard class predictions and probabilities:\n    * Class predictions should be factors with the same levels as the original outcome and named `.pred_class`. \n    * For class probability predictions, the columns should be named the same as the factor levels, e.g., `.pred_{level}`, and there should be as many columns as factor levels. \n\nIn the classification case, your submission must have columns for _both_ hard class predictions (i.e. `.pred_class`) and probabilities (i.e. `.pred_{level_1}`, `.pred_{level_2}`, etc)."

The challenge is that I only have 250 training samples but need to avoid overfitting. I want to evaluate performance using AUC ROC - can you help me approach this modeling problem?\n\nknowledge: You are predicting a binary target variable associated with each row in the dataset. The training data consists of 250 rows with 300 continuous variables (numbered 0-299) plus an id column and the binary target variable. The test set contains 19,750 rows with the same structure but without the target variable. The key challenge is avoiding overfitting given the small training sample size relative to the number of features (20,000x200 matrix mentioned refers to the combined train/test data dimensions). Submissions should predict probabilities for the target variable and are evaluated using AUC ROC between predicted and actual target values. The submission format requires id and target columns, where target represents the predicted probability for each test sample. A sample submission file is provided showing the correct format with ids starting from 300.\n\ndir: DSBench/data_modeling/data/data_resplit/dont-overfit-ii",

This is worse than random guessing and is a classic sign of overfitting due to the high number of features compared to the number of samples.\n\nTo address this, I'll use a regularized regression model. Specifically, I'll try a LASSO model, which is a type of penalized logistic regression that can shrink the coefficients of unimportant features to zero, effectively performing feature selection. This is a great technique for high-dimensional datasets like yours.\n\nI'll tune the `penalty` hyperparameter to find the optimal amount of regularization.

This is worse than random guessing and is a classic sign of overfitting due to the high number of features compared to the number of samples.\n\nTo address this, I'll use a regularized regression model.

This is worse than random guessing and is a classic sign of overfitting due to the high number of features compared to the number of samples.\n\nTo address this, I'll use a regularized regression model. Specifically, I'll try a LASSO model, which is a type of penalized logistic regression that can shrink the coefficients of unimportant features to zero, effectively performing feature selection. This is a great technique for high-dimensional datasets like yours.\n\nI'll tune the `penalty` hyperparameter to find the optimal amount of regularization.

This is worse than random guessing and is a classic sign of overfitting due to the high number of features compared to the number of samples.\n\nTo address this, I'll use a regularized regression model. Specifically, I'll try a LASSO model, which is a type of penalized logistic regression that can shrink the coefficients of unimportant features to zero, effectively performing feature selection. This is a great technique for high-dimensional datasets like yours.\n\nI'll tune the `penalty` hyperparameter to find the optimal amount of regularization. This experiment will run asynchronously in the background."

This strongly suggests that the issue is not with the models themselves, but with the data and how it's being processed within the resampling folds. The error \"contrasts can be applied only to factors with 2 or more levels\" keeps pointing to a problem with factor variables having only one level. However, all our predictors are numeric, so this is quite strange.\n\nLet's try to debug this. I'll take one of the resampling folds and see if any of the columns have only one unique value. This will help us understand what's causing the error."

Instead of a random forest, I'll use a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. SVMs are often effective in high-dimensional spaces and can be less sensitive to issues like zero-variance predictors within folds.

Instead of relying on a model to handle the high dimensionality, I'll use a dimensionality reduction technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a great choice for this. PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe.

It's possible the issue is more subtle, perhaps related to how `tidymodels` is handling the data internally during the modeling process, or it's a problem with a different fold.\n\nLet's try a different approach to feature selection. Instead of relying on a model to handle the high dimensionality, I'll use a dimensionality reduction technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a great choice for this. PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe. I'll tune the number of PCA components to keep. This experiment will run asynchronously.",

SVMs are often effective in high-dimensional spaces and can be less sensitive to issues like zero-variance predictors within folds. I'll tune the `cost` and `rbf_sigma` hyperparameters.\n\nThis experiment will run asynchronously."

Instead of relying on a model to handle the high dimensionality, I'll use a dimensionality reduction technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a great choice for this. PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe. I'll tune the number of PCA components to keep. This experiment will run asynchronously."

This is worse than random guessing and is a classic sign of overfitting due to the high number of features compared to the number of samples.\n\nTo address this, I'll use a regularized regression model. Specifically, I'll try a LASSO model, which is a type of penalized logistic regression that can shrink the coefficients of unimportant features to zero, effectively performing feature selection. This is a great technique for high-dimensional datasets like yours.\n\nI'll tune the `penalty` hyperparameter to find the optimal amount of regularization. This experiment will run asynchronously in the background."

Instead of a random forest, I'll use a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. SVMs are often effective in high-dimensional spaces and can be less sensitive to issues like zero-variance predictors within folds.

Instead of relying on a model to handle the high dimensionality, I'll use a dimensionality reduction technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a great choice for this. PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe.

This is a great technique for high-dimensional datasets like yours.\n\nI'll tune the `penalty` hyperparameter to find the optimal amount of regularization.

I'll use the same recipe as before, with all the predictors, but I'll be more confident that it will work this time, given our successful subset experiment.\n\nI'll tune the `penalty` hyperparameter again to find the optimal amount of regularization.

Instead of a random forest, I'll use a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel.

Instead of relying on a model to handle the high dimensionality, I'll use a dimensionality reduction technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a great choice for this. PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe.

PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe.

Instead of a random forest, I'll use a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel.

Instead of relying on a model to handle the high dimensionality, I'll use a dimensionality reduction technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a great choice for this. PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe.

I'll use the same recipe as before, with all the predictors, but I'll be more confident that it will work this time, given our successful subset experiment.\n\nI'll tune the `penalty` hyperparameter again to find the optimal amount of regularization.

Instead of relying on a model to handle the high dimensionality, I'll use a dimensionality reduction technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a great choice for this. PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe.

This strongly suggests that the previous errors were indeed caused by the high dimensionality of the data, although the error message was misleading. The model with 10 predictors had an AUC ROC of about 0.53, which is still not great, but it's an improvement over the model with all 300 predictors.\n\nNow that we have a working model, let's go back to the LASSO model, which showed so much promise. I'll use the same recipe as before, with all the predictors, but I'll be more confident that it will work this time, given our successful subset experiment.\n\nI'll tune the `penalty` hyperparameter again to find the optimal amount of regularization.

It's possible the issue is more subtle, perhaps related to how `tidymodels` is handling the data internally during the modeling process, or it's a problem with a different fold.\n\nLet's try a different approach to feature selection. Instead of relying on a model to handle the high dimensionality, I'll use a dimensionality reduction technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a great choice for this. PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe. I'll tune the number of PCA components to keep. This experiment will run asynchronously."

It's possible that while no single feature has zero variance across the *entire* training set, some features might have zero variance within a specific *resampling fold*.\n\nTo address this, I'll try a different approach. Instead of a random forest, I'll use a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. SVMs are often effective in high-dimensional spaces and can be less sensitive to issues like zero-variance predictors within folds.

Instead of relying on a model to handle the high dimensionality, I'll use a dimensionality reduction technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a great choice for this. PCA will transform the 300 predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, which should help to reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n\nI'll create a new recipe that includes a PCA step and then try the logistic regression model again with this new recipe.
